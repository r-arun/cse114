2. Get a binary number as a String and flip the 0's and 1's in the number. Use StringBuilder/
StringBuffer APIs to perform this operation and return the flipped number.

Sample Input:
-------------
0101

Sample Output:
--------------
1010

3. We are going to write the numbers from 1 to n ecah separated by a space in a file. Writing a file
is not much different from printing to console. Use File and PrintWriter classes as in lecture to 
write the file. You must get the last number to be printed and the name of the file from the console
as usual (need not be read from another file).

4. Read a file using the API given by File class and Scanner. Read the previously written file in question
3 and find the sum of all numbers in the file. You can use hasNextInt() similar to hasNext() method and
use nextInt() to read the integer.

You must get the name of the file from the console and check if the file exists before you start reading.
