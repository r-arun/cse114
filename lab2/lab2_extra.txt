1) Take user input and identify whether the given input is a leap year.

2) This program will introduce you to the concept of loops :-

public class ExampleLoop{

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		for(int i=0; i < 5 ; i = i + 1)
		{
			System.out.println("Hello");
		}
		System.out.println("End");
		
	}

}

3) Take user input and Extend the above program to execute the System.out.println("Hello"); statement as per the user-input.

4) Simulate multiplication as addition.
   i.e. result = a * b; must be performed as repeated additions.
   Hint :- Use loop and multiplication by definition is repeated addition.
