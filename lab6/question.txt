*Warm Up: String position
Take a string as input. And position in the string. Print the character at
that position.

*Question: Even Vowel
A string is an Even Vowel if all characters in even position (0, 2, 4, ...) are vowels (one of a, e, i, o, u). Write a Java program to get a String with
lower case alphabets as input and print whether it is an Even Vowel or not.
Note that the first character in a String is at position 0. 

Sample Input:

*Warmup: Write a function that takes an integer n as input and prints "Hello
World" n times.

*Question: Simple Function
Write a Java function to take a String s, an integer n as inputs and print
the string s, repeatedly in n lines. Get the string and integer from command
line as inputs.

Sample Input:
Hello
5

Sample Output:
Hello
Hello
Hello
Hello
Hello

*Follow up:
Modify the function to take a boolean variable. If the variable is true,
print line numbers from 1 to n. Else print from 0 to n-1.

*Question: Pyramids
Write a Java program to take an odd number n as input and print triangle in
a pyramidal pattern in the next m = n/2 + 1 lines. In this pattern the ith
line contains (m-i)/2 spaces followed by 2*i-1 stars.

Sample Input:
5

Sample Output:

*Warm Up: Square function
Define a function sqaure to take an integer as a parameter and return the
square of the number.

*Question: Nested Functions
Define a function sum_of_squares that takes an n, integer as input and finds
the sum of squares of numbers from 1 to n. Use square function written in
the previous program to compute the square of a number.

*Question: Binary to Integer
Write a Java program to get a String representing a binary number as input.
Write a Java function to convert this String to the corresponding decimal
number. The method must take a String variable as a parameter and return an
int.

Sample Input:
1001
Sample Output:
9

*Question: Sum of digits of an integer
