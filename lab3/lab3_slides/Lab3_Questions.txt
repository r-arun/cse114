1. Warmp Up program:
--------------------
Write a Java class to get two integers as input and find the bigger number. If they are equal, print that both numbers are equal.

Sample Code:
------------
import java.util.Scanner;
public class BigTwo {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
		System.out.println("Enter the first number");
		int a = input.nextInt();
		System.out.println("Enter the second number");
		int b = input.nextInt();
		if( a > b){
			System.out.println(a+" is bigger than "+b);
		}
		if( a < b){
			System.out.println(b+" is bigger than "+a);
		}
		if( a == b){
			System.out.println(a+" is equal to "+b);
		}

	}

}

2. Warm Up program:
-------------------
Write a Java class to input a positive integer and find if it is even or odd.

Sample Code:
------------
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Even {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println("Enter a positive interger as input");
		Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
		int num = input.nextInt();
		int remainder = num % 2;
		if(remainder == 0){
			System.out.println(num+ " is an even number");
		}
		else{
			System.out.println(num+" is an odd number");
		}
		System.out.println("End of Processing");
	}

}

3. Write a Java class to get three integers as input and find the biggest of three.
Make sure your program runs for different input cases.
Sample Input:
-------------
Enter three numbers:
7 10 20
Sample Output:
--------------
20 is the biggest number.

4. An integer is a good number if it is a multiple of either 2 or 3 (not both).
If an integer is a multiple of both 2 and 3, it is an excellent number. If a 
number is neither good nor excellent it is a bad number.

Write a Java class to get an integer as input and print whether a number is
good, excellent or bad.

Sample Input:
-------------
8
Sample Output:
--------------
Good Number

Sample Input:
-------------
6
Sample Output:
--------------
Excellent Number

Sample Input:
-------------
7
Sample Output:
--------------
Bad Number

5. A weather map has regions colored in different colors depending on the
temperature. Our weather map uses the below colors based on the temperature
range.

Greater or equal than 40 - Red
From 30 till 40 - Yellow (30 <= temp < 40)
From 20 till 30 - Green (20 <= temp < 30)
From 10 till 20 - Blue (10 <= temp < 20)
Below 10 - White

Write a Java program to get the temperature of a region as an integer and
print the color for the region. Use if - else structure. But you are not 
allowed to use '&&' or '&'

6. Do the weather map problem using 'if' conditional structure, but do not use any 'else'.
Hint: Use '&&'.

7. Read the below program and give suitable inputs for variables a and c, such that the lines
a is 4.0
d is 4

are printed when you run the program. Can you always ensure that both lines
get printed?

import java.util.Scanner;
public class ExpressionEval {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
		System.out.println("Enter a positive integer as input");
		int a = input.nextInt();
		System.out.println("Enter a real number as input");
		double c = input.nextDouble();
		if(a == 4.0){
			System.out.println("a is 4.0"); //Line to be printed
		}
		double e = (4/3.0) * 3.0;
		if(e == 4){
			System.out.println("e is 4.0");
		}
		double d = (4/3.0 + 1.0 - 0.5 - c)*3.0;
		if(a == d){
			System.out.println("d is 4"); //Line to be printed
		}
		System.out.println("End of execution");
	}

}

8. Make use of switch case statements to get the college year as input and
print the below.
1 -> Freshman
2 -> Sophomore
3 -> Junior
4 or above -> Senior

Make sure your program handles cases when incorrect input is given.

9. Five Days of Summer:
Your local store provides winners of a lucky draw with gifts on five days.
The gift details are given below.

Day 1: 1 Microphone
Day 2: 2 Loudspeakers
Day 3: 3 Keyboards
Day 4: 4 Java Books
Day 5: 5 iPhones

The gifts are accumulative. The winner of any day gets the gift for the day
and the gifts for all previous days during which a gift was given.

 For example Day 3 winner gets:
 3 Keyboards
 2 Loudspeakers (Day 2)
 1 Microphone (Day 1)

First listed is Day 3 gift (3 Keyboards), then gifts from previous days in order
2 Loudspeakers (Day 2) and 1 Microphone (Day 1).

Write a Java program to get a day (1 - 5) as input and print the gifts a
winner on the day will win. While printing, list the gifts based on the
descending order of days (as in Day 3 example above). Also ensure that you
get valid a day number as input.
