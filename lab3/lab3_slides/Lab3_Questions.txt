1. Warmp Up program:
--------------------
Write a Java class to get two integers as input and find the bigger number. If they are equal, print that both numbers are equal.

Sample Code:
------------
import java.util.Scanner;
public class BigTwo {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
		System.out.println("Enter the first number");
		int a = input.nextInt();
		System.out.println("Enter the second number");
		int b = input.nextInt();
		if( a > b){
			System.out.println(a+" is bigger than "+b);
		}
		if( a < b){
			System.out.println(b+" is bigger than "+a);
		}
		if( a == b){
			System.out.println(a+" is equal to "+b);
		}

	}

}

2. Warm Up program:
-------------------
Write a Java class to input a positive integer and find if it is even or odd.

Sample Code:
------------
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Even {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println("Enter a positive interger as input");
		Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
		int num = input.nextInt();
		int remainder = num % 2;
		if(remainder == 0){
			System.out.println(num+ " is an even number");
		}
		else{
			System.out.println(num+" is an odd number");
		}
		System.out.println("End of Processing");
	}

}

3. Write a Java class to get three integers as input and find the biggest of three.
Make sure your program runs for different input cases.
Sample Input:
-------------
Enter three numbers:
7 10 20
Sample Output:
--------------
20 is the biggest number.

4. An integer is a good number if it is a multiple of either 2 or 3 (not both).
If an integer is a multiple of both 2 and 3, it is an excellent number. If a 
number is neither good nor excellent it is a bad number.

Write a Java class to get an integer as input and print whether a number is
good, excellent or bad.

Sample Input:
-------------
8
Sample Output:
--------------
Good Number

Sample Input:
-------------
6
Sample Output:
--------------
Excellent Number

Sample Input:
-------------
7
Sample Output:
--------------
Bad Number

5. A weather map has regions colored in different colors depending on the
temperature. Our weather map uses the below color codes Yellow (Y), Red (R),
Green (G), Blue (B) and White (W) based on the temperature range.

Greater or equal than 40 - R
From 30 till 40 - Y (30 <= temp < 40)
From 20 till 30 - G (20 <= temp < 30)
From 10 till 20 - B (10 <= temp < 20)
Below 10 - W

Write a Java program to get the temperature of a region as an integer and
print the color code (single character) for the region.

6. Make use of if - else statements to get the college year as input and
print the below.
1 -> Freshman
2 -> Sophomore
3 -> Junior
4 or above -> Senior

Make sure your program handles cases when incorrect input is given (this has
credits too).

7. Read the below program and give suitable inputs for variables a and c, such that the lines
a is 4.0
d is 4

are printed when you run the program. Can you always ensure that both lines
get printed?

import java.util.Scanner;
public class ExpressionEval {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
		System.out.println("Enter a positive integer as input");
		int a = input.nextInt();
		System.out.println("Enter a real number as input");
		double c = input.nextDouble();
		if(a == 4.0){
			System.out.println("a is 4.0"); //Line to be printed
		}
		double e = (4/3.0) * 3.0;
		if(e == 4){
			System.out.println("e is 4.0");
		}
		double d = (4/3.0 + 1.0 - 0.5 - c)*3.0;
		if(a == d){
			System.out.println("d is 4"); //Line to be printed
		}
		System.out.println("End of execution");
	}

}
