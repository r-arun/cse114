Part 1
======
1. Write a Java Program to print "Hello World!" in the console.

Sample Solution
===============

public class HelloWorld {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println("Hello World!");
	}

}

2. Write a Java Program to print your name, age and weight.
3. Write a Java Program to print a right angled triangle of height 4. In particular print a pattern made of asteriks (*) that looks like this.

4. Write a Java Program to print a person's name, age and weight. Use variables of type String, int and double.

Sample Solution
===============

public class VariablesExample {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		String name;
		int age;
		double weight;
		name = "Harry";
		age = 20;
		weight = 150.6;
		System.out.print("Your Name is ");
		System.out.println(name);
		System.out.print("Your Age is ");
		System.out.println(age+" years");
		System.out.print("Your weight is ");
		System.out.println(weight+" lb");
	}

}

Part 2
======
5. Write a Java Program that gets a person's name, age and weight as inputs from standard input and print these in the below format as output.

Sample Input:
-------------
Enter Name: Harry
Enter Age: 20
Enter Weight: 157.6

Sample Output:
--------------
Your Name is Harry.
Your Age is 20 years.
Your Weight is 157.6 lbs.

6. Write a Java program to get two integers as input and perform the below operations on the variables.
a) Addition: 5 + 4 = 9
b) Subtraction: 5 - 4 = 1
c) Mutiplication: 6 * 4 = 24
d) Division: 16 / 4 = 4. Also 6 / 4 = 2. (Just the quotient).
e) Modulo: 6 % 4 = 2. 8 % 4 = 0. (Remainder on division).

Sample Solution:
----------------
/**
 * Arithmetic in Java
 */
import java.util.Scanner;
public class ArithmeticExamples {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
		int a, b;
		a = input.nextInt();
		b = input.nextInt();
		int sum = a + b;
		int diff = a - b;
		int mult = a * b;
		int div = a / b;
		int mod = a % b;
		System.out.println("Sum is " + sum);
		System.out.println("Difference is " + diff);
		System.out.println("Product is " + mult);
		System.out.println("Quotient is " + div);
		System.out.println("Modulo is " + mod);
	}

}

7. Write a Java program to get two floating point numbers as input and perform the same operations as Question 6.

8. Debug the below program. 
import java.util.Scanner;
/* Program for debug.
 * This piece of code has some bugs.
 * Other than bugs it has code written
 * in bad style. 
 * Correct the bugs and rewrite the code
 * in a good style.
 * Hint: Follow the squiggly lines
 */
public class DebugExample {
	public static void main(String args) {
		Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
		int a, b;
		int sum, Diff, mod;
		a = input.nextInt(); b = input.nextInt();
		sum = a+b;
		Diff = a-b;
		int mult = a* b;
		div = a /b;
		mod = a%b;
		System.out.println("Sum is ",sum);
		System.out.println("Difference is "+diff);
		System.out.println("Product is "+mult);
		System.out.println("Quotient is "+div);
		System.out.println("Modulo is "+mod);
		input.close();
	}
}

9. Write a Java Program to print the asterik triangle in a flipped pattern. The pattern must look the one below.

10. Print the Pascal's triangle of height 4.
   1
  1 1
 1 2 1
1 3 3 1
 
Note that last line does not have any
space before the first 1.
 
Hint 1: Start thinking from the bottom. Draw grids on paper.
Hint 2: How many spaces does fourth (last) line need
		before the first 1?
		What about third line, second line and so on?

11. ChangeMaker.
Your friend works at a cash counter. Whenever she has to
return some change, she needs to calculate the type of coins
she must return. She dispenses change based on the below
conditions.

1. First give change in quarters (25 cents) (as much as possible).
2. Then in dimes (10 cents).
3. Then in nickel (5 cents).
4. Then in penny (1 cent).

You have learnt Java Programming today and help her out
to quickly dispense change!

Read the sample input and output for hints.

Sample Input:
80

Sample Output:
Number of Quarters: 3
Number of Dimes: 0
Number of Nickels: 1
Number of Pennies: 0

Sample Input:
99

Sample Output:
Number of Quarters: 3
Number of Dimes: 2
Number of Nickels: 0
Number of Pennies: 4

Sample Input:
24

Sample Output:
Number of Quarters: 0
Number of Dimes: 2
Number of Nickels: 0
Number of Pennies: 4
